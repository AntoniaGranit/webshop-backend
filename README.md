This is the backend repository for a webshop hobby project I am currently working on. I originially wanted to try building it with Python, FastAPI and PostGreSQL, but since I haven't built a webshop before I wanted to first try it out in a language I know. I am glad I did, since even with Node.js, Express and MongoDB, this proved quite challenging for me. I hope to go back to the backend when I'm done with the frontend and rebuild it in Python, though.

## The problem

Getting around the logic of creating endpoints for adding and removing items corresponding to specific items in my database to and from the shopping cart was a bit of a challenge, but MongoDB makes it quite intuitive and pain-free with its built-in functionalities. I also had some issues with the structure of the shopping cart in the response, but it all looks exactly how I want it now.
