This is the backend repository for a webshop hobby project I am currently working on. I originially wanted to try building it with Python, FastAPI and PostGreSQL, but since I haven't built a webshop before I wanted to first try it out in a language I know. I am glad I did, since even with Node.js, Express and MongoDB, this proved quite challenging for me. I hope to go back to the backend when I'm done with the frontend and rebuild it in Python, though.

## The problem

Getting around the logic of creating endpoints for adding and removing items from the shopping cart was a challenge for me, as I haven't done this before. I'm still working on the structure of the shopping cart, as I want it to specify the quantity of the same product in the cart (if there's more than one) instead of just adding new objects to the shopping cart array with the quantity of one.
